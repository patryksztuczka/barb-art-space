  "aboutMeDescription": "Born and raised in Poland, I owe my interest in art to my grandmother who introduced me to crafts and drawing when I was a wee baby. That simple interest blossomed into a strong passion that’s been driving me to create ever since.\n\nI’ve graduated High School of Fine Arts in Bydgoszcz, Poland and got my diploma in interior design there. Living in Poland my whole life I’ve decided to move to Rotterdam, NL to continue my education in spatial design in Willem de Kooning Academy. I’ve dropped out after a year after I’ve discovered User Interface design and fell head over heels for it - I’ve found my one true love!\n\nI am a fresh minded creative who loves to discover new styles and solutions. I do my best work when I have a team of creative individuals to bounce my ideas off of and brainstorm what could be done, what could be improved and challenge each other to be better designers every day.\n\nAfter working as a UI/UX designer for almost 3 years I’m looking to gain more experience in this field and acquire more skills, more knowledge and use my creative thinking for great things.\n\nFun fact - I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting Star Wars memorabilia and action figures.",
